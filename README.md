# Employee_Salary_Manager
This project was built to strengthen the core concepts of Object Oriented Programming.

This project is about a company in which there are two types of employee viz sales and production. The manager just enters basic salary, actual work done and target of the work.
The bonus is calculated and at last there is a very novice authentication system (please type password as 123 to see the result). Then, before the actual display, there is a very novice 
use of threads and pressing 's' (without quotes) stops it. 

To run this project, clone the repository into your local machine, open it in any text editor and run it.

PS - This is a very beginner level project and not very well structured one.
